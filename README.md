# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Description:

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the famous Titanic dataset, the goal is to build a predictive model that classifies passengers as either survivors or non-survivors based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Thorough cleaning and preprocessing of the Titanic dataset to handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and prepare the data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth exploration of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of survivors/non-survivors across different features.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

Model Building: Utilizing machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) to build a predictive model for survival prediction.

Visualization: Visualizing the distribution of survival outcomes and exploring relationships between survival and various factors.

Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib
